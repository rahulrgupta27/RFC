Each VM has its own MAC.
lots of VMs => lots of MAC => huge MAC address table in the switch.

Switch helps PC to communicate with each other on the same LAN, ie -
1. In same IP-subnet.
2. communicatio happens with the help of MAC address.

when a packet is sent from one machine (pc1) to PC2 connnected via routers.
then when pkts reaches to router R1, then configuration is- 
src_mac, src_ip = pc1.
dest_mac = R1
dest_ip = pc2

configuration when pkt goes out from R1 to R2-
src_mac = R1
src_ip = R1
dest_mac = R2
dest_ip = R2
